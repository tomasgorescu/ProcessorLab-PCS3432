This repo contains my working during the MicroProcessors Lab subject I took at University of Sao Paulo. For those interested, the subject 'id' is PCS3432.

Even though it's a closed course, I followed the exercises from the book "ARM Laboratory Exercises™, For the ARM Evaluator-7T™ Board and the OKI ML67Q4000™ MCU Evaluation Board". In here, you may find the solution to -almost- all the exercises in the book.
